# Notes about my books

I'm following the process described in this
[article by Barry Davret](https://medium.com/@Barry.Davret/how-to-get-10x-the-value-from-every-book-you-read-90166d672988)
to get more value from every book I read.

Each folder represents a category of books which may change. The process follows
these steps:
* Read and Mark - Highlight the passages of interest, a critical insight, or
the main ideas as you read the book.
* Harvest - After finishing the book, create a document in the appropriate
folder for that book and revisit the marked passages on the book. You can
either copy that passage to the document or explain it with your own words.
* Edit - Try to edit your text to fit it in five pages at maximum
* Master - Read your book summary once a day for two weeks after you finish
the editing process. To get more value, you may organize your main ideas by
writing it down (e.g.; in an article)
* Categorize - After many books, create a file with the **best of the best**
to capture the top highlights of each category. You should try to keep this
document short too.
