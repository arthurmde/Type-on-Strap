I am a Brazilian who lives in the magnificent city of São Paulo together
with my beloved Ana Paula. I come from a traditional family from Minas Gerais,
my home state, and everything I have built and learned has the light of
my parents and my brother.

Besides that, I am a Software Engineer who loves hacking and learning
new things, especially in the context of free software, agile methods,
systems design, and DevOps. I am also very passionate about music, movies,
collecting, reading, traveling, and people!

In 2014, I got my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at
[University of Brasilia (UnB)](http://www.unb.br/). 
Currently, I am pursuing a master’s degree in Computer Science at the
[Institute of Mathematics and Statistics at University of São Paulo (USP)](http://ime.usp.br/)
and contributing to the Debian project as a GSoC student.

## My Relationship with Free Software

During my graduation period, I became a free software enthusiast, and since 2013
I have attended community events and contributed to free software projects. My
early involvement with these communities contributed significantly to my
education, both in the technical and social aspects, as well as bringing me many
opportunities.
Among others, I highlight the opportunities to become a member of
the LAPPIS, a research lab in FLOSS and agile methods at UnB where I worked as
a developer on the [New Brazilian Public Software Portal](https://softwarepublico.gov.br/social/).

After that, I worked for more than a year at [Colivre](http://colivre.coop.br/),
a cooperative company that provides IT services,
specialized in the development of free web solutions. There I worked mainly
contributing to the [Noosfero](http://noosfero.org/) project, a free web platform
for social networks.

During my master's degree, I have been developing the [InterSCity
platform](http://interscity.org/software/interscity-platform/), a
microservices-based, cloud-native middleware for smart cities.
More recently, I got my project accepted in Google Summer of Code to work
with Debian community, as described in [this post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url

## Skills

As a consequence of my training and my earlier
contributions to free software projects, I’ve developed various technical skills
which include good practices of software engineering, TDD, refactoring, system
design, microservices architectures, and DevOps.

I work with Linux and Git daily.
As most of the projects I've worked on is Web-based, I’m quite familiar with web
technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, WebSocket, and web
frameworks. More precisely, Ruby is my primary programming language, and I have
three years of experience with Ruby on Rails. Also, I’m fairly confident to work
with Python and Django since I used them before in other projects and during the
[GSoC program]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url

as I became more familiar with microservices architecture, I’ve been working
with DevOps tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible.
